# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Hunia Nadeem, a Software Engineering Intern at Devsinc Islamabad. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About me
I'm a web developer with a passion for constantly learning and improving my skills. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at COMSATS University Islamabad, where I am in my third year of study.
My experience includes working with a variety of tech stacks, including MERN and LAMP. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

## What I'm working on
We are currently utilizing Ruby on Rails for the backend development, with a focus on this framework. For the front-end development, we are using both Ruby and React. Additionally, we will be using a Postgresql database for this project.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸŒŸ
